-Can you use Viper to ?
    + When developing and deploying a backend web application, 
      we usually have to use different configurations for different environments 
      such as development, testing, staging, and production.
      
-Why file and environment variables?
     +Reading values from file allows us to easily specify default configuration for local development and testing.
     +While reading values from environment variables will help us override the default settings when deploying 
     our application to staging or production using docker containers.
